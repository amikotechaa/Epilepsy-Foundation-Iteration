			<h2>Background</h2>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>Around 65 million people in the world live with epilepsy, making it one of the most common neurological disorder. Epilepsy is a medical condition that affects the brain and causes seizures.</p>
      <p>Not all people who have seizures are diagnosed with epilepsy. In Australia, around 10% of the population will experience a seizure in their lifetime, but much fewer will be diagnosed with epilepsy. At the moment around 250,000 Australians, or 1% of our population, live with epilepsy.</p>
      <p>Epilepsy occurs regardless of age, gender, cultural or socio-economic background. Epilepsy can develop at any stage of life, but it is more common in children, adolescents, and people over 60.</p>
      <p>There are at least 40 different types of seizures. A person with epilepsy may experience one or more seizure type. Their behaviour during a seizure depends on the type of seizure and the area of the brain being affected.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the Epilepsy Foundation website is to provide information and support to individuals with epilepsy or that know someone with epilepsy. It is also used to receive donations from the public so they can advance their epilepsy research and provide better support to individuals and their families with epilepsy. The charity was established in 1963 and operates in Victoria and NSW</p>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>After I received user feedback from the interviews, I conducted I was able to understand what I could do to improve the Epilepsy Foundation website. I decided to keep the colour palette similar as they did a good job of this in the original website. My main ideas stemmed from the motive to make the page very easy to understand and straightforward. </p>

			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>I want to keep the same colour palate as the original website because the colours work well together, and they are the colours of the logo. I want the photos to have colours that are similar to the palate of the website, so they are easy on the eyes and don’t stand out amongst the important information on the website.</p>

			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>These are very rough sketches on the layout of the home page and a subcategory page. I have set out where I want things to go and what I want to be included in the page. The drop-down menus at the top bar are much more simplified than the original website to make sure the user isn’t overwhelmed with the information and what to click on. I also put a ‘donate now’ option on the home page to allow the user to directly donate when they open the website. </p>

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>Using miro and Figma I was able to create a site map, wireframes and mock-ups of the new website. I first built on the sketches I made to create wireframes that gave a basic visual of the layout of elements on the page. After this I created the mock-ups that would replicate what I want the website to look like. </p>
