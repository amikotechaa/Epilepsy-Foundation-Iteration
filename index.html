			<h2>Font</h2>
			<p>I decided to use Helvetica sans-serif font instead of the ‘Harmattan’ font as I think this font is easier to read.</p>

			<h2>Pages</h2>
			<p>For this purpose of this assignment, only creating a couple of pages I decided to keep the pages with the most essential
				information. After gathering information from family and friends and from own self-reflection, I decided the most important
				pages were the home page with information on the organisation, the about epilepsy page and the donation page.
				<p>On the about page I decided to include a video as giving visuals would be much more engaging for the audience.

		<section id="nav">
			<h2>Nav</h2>
			<p>I decided to have less navigation titles for the purpose of the assignment. I also got rid of the drop-down menu as there are not as many pages anymore. I also decided to change the hover colour of the navigation to be the dark purple colour to make it clearer to give clearer user feedback that they are hovering over a heading. I decided to keep the colour palate consistent throughout the website mainly using the colours of dark purple, blue and black which align with the company’s logo.</p>

		<section id="footer">
			<h2>Footer</h2>
			<p>After gaining feedback from my family and friends the main feedback of the footer was to make it easier to read and to have the social media links be bigger as they are an important part of the company. I took on their advice and changed the layout. </p>
